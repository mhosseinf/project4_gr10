Rainfall forecasting involves considering various meteorological parameters. Here are some key parameters that are important for rain forecast:

1-Precipitation:

Rainfall Amount: The amount of rain expected over a specific period (e.g., hourly, daily).
Rainfall Intensity: The rate of rainfall, often measured in millimeters per hour.

2-Humidity:

Relative Humidity: The percentage of moisture in the air relative to the maximum amount the air could hold at that temperature. High humidity levels are conducive to precipitation.
Temperature:

3-Air Temperature: 
Warmer air can hold more moisture. Temperature changes can influence the likelihood of precipitation.
Atmospheric Pressure:

4-Low-Pressure Systems: Areas of low pressure are often associated with rising air, which can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation.
Wind:

5-Wind Speed and Direction: 
Strong winds can transport moisture and influence precipitation patterns.

6-Cloud Cover:

Cloud Type and Altitude: Certain cloud types, such as cumulonimbus clouds, are associated with heavy rainfall.
Weather Patterns:

7-Fronts: 
The interaction of different air masses (cold and warm fronts) can lead to the lifting of air and subsequent precipitation.
Topography:

8-Orographic Lift: 
The lifting of air over mountains can lead to the cooling and condensation of moisture, resulting in precipitation.
Satellite and Radar Data:

9-Satellite Imagery: 
Observing cloud patterns and movement.
Radar Data: Detecting precipitation and estimating its intensity.
Historical Data:

10-Past Rainfall Patterns: 
Historical data on rainfall in the region can provide insights into seasonal trends.
