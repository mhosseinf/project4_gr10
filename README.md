	## 2-1: We bbtained an API key from the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development website at https://www.wa.gov.au/organisation/department-of-primary-industries-and-regional-development.

	## 2-2: We sent an API request to retrieve rain data, including rainfall, humidity, average air temperature, and average wind speed.

	## 2-3: We successfully retrieved 365 days of data from 225 weather stations across WA. Saved it as raindata.csv and prepared it for machine learning.

Rainfall forecasting involves considering various meteorological parameters. Here are some key parameters that are important for rain forecast:

1-Precipitation:

Rainfall Amount: The amount of rain expected over a specific period (e.g., hourly, daily).
Rainfall Intensity: The rate of rainfall, often measured in millimeters per hour.

2-Humidity:

Relative Humidity: The percentage of moisture in the air relative to the maximum amount the air could hold at that temperature. High humidity levels are conducive to precipitation.
Temperature:

3-Air Temperature: 
Warmer air can hold more moisture. Temperature changes can influence the likelihood of precipitation.
Atmospheric Pressure:

4-Low-Pressure Systems: Areas of low pressure are often associated with rising air, which can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation.
Wind:

5-Wind Speed and Direction: 
Strong winds can transport moisture and influence precipitation patterns.

6-Cloud Cover:

Cloud Type and Altitude: Certain cloud types, such as cumulonimbus clouds, are associated with heavy rainfall.
Weather Patterns:

7-Fronts: 
The interaction of different air masses (cold and warm fronts) can lead to the lifting of air and subsequent precipitation.
Topography:

8-Orographic Lift: 
The lifting of air over mountains can lead to the cooling and condensation of moisture, resulting in precipitation.
Satellite and Radar Data:

9-Satellite Imagery: 
Observing cloud patterns and movement.
Radar Data: Detecting precipitation and estimating its intensity.
Historical Data:

10-Past Rainfall Patterns: 
Historical data on rainfall in the region can provide insights into seasonal trends.
